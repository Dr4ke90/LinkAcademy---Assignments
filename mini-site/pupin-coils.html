            <p>Pupin's <strong>1899</strong> patent for loading coils, archaically called <q>Pupin coils</q>, followed
                closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which
                predates
                Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights
                to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph <abbr>(AT&T)</abbr>, making him wealthy. Although
                <abbr title="American Telephone & Telegraph">AT&T</abbr> bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of
                it, as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point
                been
                challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. <abbr title="American Telephone & Telegraph">AT&T</abbr>
                were
                afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to
                greatly
                extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
